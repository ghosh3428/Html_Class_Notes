        <b>Kolkata</b> (UK: /kɒlˈkɑːtə/[11] or /kɒlˈkʌtə/,[12] US: /koʊlˈkɑːtɑː/,[13] Bengali: [kolˈkata] (listen); also
        known
        as <b>Calcutta</b> /kælˈkʌtə/[12][13] which was the official name until 2001) is the capital and largest city of
        the
        Indian state of West Bengal. It is on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River 80 km (50 mi) west of the border
        with Bangladesh. It is the primary business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern India and the main port of
        communication for North-East India.[14] According to the 2011 Indian census, Kolkata is the seventh-most
        populous city in India, with a population of 45 lakh (4.5 million) residents within the city. It is a part of
        Kolkata Metropolitan Area (or known as Greater Kolkata) which has a population of over 1.41 crore (14.1 million)
        residents making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. In 2021, the Kolkata metropolitan area
        crossed 1.5 crore (15 million) registered voters. The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its
        sole major riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the cultural capital of India. Kolkata is the second largest
        Bengali-speaking city after Dhaka. It has the highest number of nobel laureates among all cities in
        India.[1][15]

        In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under
        Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,[16] the area was
        developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post known as Fort William. Nawab Siraj
        ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East
        India Company was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under
        company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in
        India until 1911. In that year, after assessing its geographical location, combined with growing nationalism in
        Bengal (Calcutta became the centre for the Indian independence movement), the British moved the capital to the
        relatively more centrally located New Delhi.

        Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the premier centre of Indian commerce, culture, and
        politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation before it rebounded.[17] The city
        was also flooded with Hindu refugees from East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) in the decades following the 1947
        partition of India, transforming its landscape and shaping its politics.[18][19] A demographically diverse
        global city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods
        (paras) and freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to eastern India's film industry, known as
        Tollywood, and cultural institutions, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic
        Society, the Indian Museum, and the National Library of India. Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the
        Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta
        Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Institution
        of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four Nobel laureates
        and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city.[20] Though home to major cricketing venues
        and franchises, Kolkata stands out in India for being the country's centre of association football and also
        having strong culture in other sports less widespread elsewhere. Hence, Kolkata is also known as 'the city of
        joy'.[21]

        The partition of Bengal in 1905 along religious lines led to mass protests, making Calcutta a less hospitable
        place for the British.[44][45] The capital was moved to New Delhi in 1911.[46] Calcutta continued to be a centre
        for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were
        bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II.[47][48] Millions starved to
        death during the Bengal famine of 1943 (at the same time of the war) due to a combination of military,
        administrative, and natural factors.[49] Demands for the creation of a Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of
        communal violence that killed over 4,000.[50][51][52] The partition of India led to further clashes and a
        demographic shift—many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of
        Hindus fled into the city.[53]

        During the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist–Maoist movement by groups
        known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city's infrastructure, resulting in economic stagnation.[17] The
        Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 led to a massive influx of thousands of refugees, many of them penniless, that
        strained Kolkata's infrastructure.[54] During the mid-1980s, Mumbai (then called Bombay) overtook Kolkata as
        India's most populous city. In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi dubbed Kolkata a "dying city" in light of its
        socio-political woes.[55] In the period 1977–2011, West Bengal was governed from Kolkata by the Left Front,
        which was dominated by the Communist Party of India (CPM). It was the world's longest-serving democratically
        elected communist government, during which Kolkata was a key base for Indian communism.[56][57][58] In the 2011
        West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Left Front was defeated by the Trinamool Congress. The city's
        economic recovery gathered momentum after the 1990s, when India began to institute pro-market reforms. Since
        2000, the information technology (IT) services sector has revitalised Kolkata's stagnant economy. The city is
        also experiencing marked growth in its manufacturing base.[59]
