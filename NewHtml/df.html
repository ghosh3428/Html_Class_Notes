            assist with the Project.</p>
        <p>(e) If there is any doubt as to whether any particular information constitutes Confidential Information, the
            Receiving Party should presume it is Confidential Information, until the Receiving Party obtains explicit
            confirmation from the Disclosing Party that it is not Confidential Information. <br /><br />(f) Each Party's
            respective obligations of confidentiality under this clause will survive the termination or expiration of

            create, contribute to, write, or produce intellectual property ("Project Intellectual Property").
            <br /><br />(b) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Project Intellectual Property" includes but is not
            limited to:</p>
        <p>(I) information, ideas, innovations, developments, improvements, inventions, discoveries, plans, reports,
            drawings, specifications, advice, analyses, designs, methodologies, code, artwork, or any other intellectual

            behalf of the Project (whether performed by the Party or by somebody else); and</p>
        <p>(III) intellectual property, whether the Party generates, creates, contributes to, writes or produces that

            Property.</p>
        <p>(d) Unless otherwise expressly agreed between the Parties, in the event that a particular Party generates,
            creates, contributes to, writes or produces an item of Project Intellectual Property, that Party shall
            retain any and all intellectual property rights in relation to that item of Project Intellectual
            Property.<br /><br />(e) Each Party's respective obligations under this clause will survive the termination
            or expiration of this Agreement and will continue after that Party ceases to participate in the Project.</p>
        <p><strong>(16). Indemnity</strong></p>
        <p>(a) Each Party (the "Indemnifying Party") will, to the extent that a claim does not arise from the negligence
            or wilful default of the other or any of its Authorised Persons, indemnify and keep indemnified on demand
            and hold harmless the other (the "Indemnified Party") and its Authorised Persons from and against all Losses
            suffered or incurred by them arising out of or in connection with:</p>
        <p>(I) any act or omission by the Indemnifying Party or any of its Authorised Persons that is in breach of this
            Agreement;</p>
        <p>(II) any breach of the warranties set out in this Agreement; and</p>
        <p>(III) any third-party claim relating to the activities of this Joint Venture to the extent that any such
            claim relates to any act, neglect, or default of the Indemnifying Party or any of its Authorised Persons.
        </p>
        <p>(b) Where the Indemnifying Party is liable to make a payment under this clauses and the payment is itself
            liable to taxation in the hands of the Indemnified Party then the amount of the indemnity payment shall be
            deemed to be increased so as to ensure that the Indemnified Party receives (after any applicable taxes have
            been paid) the same amount as it would have received had no such taxes been levied.</p>
        <p>(c) The following procedures will apply in relation to any third-party claims:</p>
        <p>(I) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Indemnified Party receives notice of any third-party claim
            qualifying for an indemnity ("TP Claim"), it will give written notice to the Indemnifying Party specifying
            details of the TP Claim. Within 30 days of being so notified (but no later than 10 days before the date on
            which any response to a TP Claim is due), the Indemnifying Party may assume control of the action and
            settlement of the TP Claim by giving a notice (Notice of Election) to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified
            Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party reasonable assistance and access relating to any such claim at
            the Indemnifying Party's reasonable request and cost; and</p>
        <p>(II) the Indemnified Party shall not make any admissions or agreements in relation to any TP Claim without
            the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. The amount due pursuant to the relevant indemnity shall be
            reduced by the extent to which the Indemnified Party has made any admissions (save where required by court
            order or governmental regulations), or agreements, without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent.
        </p>
        <p>(III) If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver a Notice of Election pursuant to sub-clause (a) above, fails
            to defend the claim in time, or ceases to defend the claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
            defend the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate provided the Indemnifying Party is not prejudiced
            by any such action.</p>
        <p><strong>(17). Limitation of liability</strong></p>
        <p>(a) The extent of the parties' liability under or in connection with this Agreement (regardless of whether
            such liability arises in tort, contract or in any other way and whether or not caused by negligence or
            misrepresentation) shall be as set out in this clause.</p>
        <p>(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, a Party's liability for any loss or damage, direct
            or indirect, for any cause whatsoever (including, but not limited to, those arising out of or related to
            this Agreement) with respect to claims (whether third party claims, indemnity claims or otherwise) shall not
            under any circumstances exceed Rs. <span id="span_id_limitedamount"><span

        <p>(c) Neither party shall be liable for any consequential, indirect, or special loss including loss of profit,
            loss of or corruption to data, loss of contract, loss of commercial opportunity and loss of goodwill.</p>
        <p>(d) Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, all warranties, and conditions whether express or implied
            by statute, common law or otherwise are excluded to the extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the liability of the parties shall not be limited
            in any way in respect of the following:</p>
        <p>(i) death or personal injury caused by negligence or willful misconduct;</p>
        <p>(ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;</p>
        <p>(iii) any other losses which cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.</p>

            indirect losses or damages, including lost profits or third-party claims arising out of or relating to its
            performance or failure to perform under this Agreement. Liability for all punitive or consequential or
            indirect losses or damages is hereby expressly excluded.</p>
        <p><strong>(18). Compliance with law</strong></p>
        <p>Each party shall comply and shall (at its own expense unless expressly agreed otherwise) ensure that in the
            performance of its duties under this Agreement, its employees, agents and representatives will comply with
            all applicable laws and regulations, provided that neither party shall be liable for any breach of this
            clause to the extent that such breach is directly caused or contributed to by any breach of this Agreement
            by the other party (or its employees, agents and representatives).</p>
        <p><strong>(19). Counterparts</strong></p>

        <p><strong>(21). Exclusivity</strong></p>
        <p>(a) Each Party (which, for the purpose of this clause is referred to as the "Representing Party") hereby
            represents to the other Party that:</p>
        <p>(I) Upon the signing of this Agreement, the Representing Party will terminate any discussions or negotiations
            with any party other than a Party to this Agreement ("Third Party"), which relate to the Joint Venture or to
            the Project ("Third Party Discussions"), in which the Representing Party, or any employee, agent, advisor,
            contractor or other representative of the Representing Party, may be engaged.<br /><br />(II) While this

        <p>(A) Engage in any Third-Party Discussions; or<br /><br />(B) Invite, encourage, seek, or otherwise solicit

            such invitation or solicitation); or<br /><br />(D) Enter into any agreement, memorandum of understanding,
            heads of agreement, letter of intent, or other arrangement with any Third Party in relation to any
            Third-Party Discussions (whether legally binding or non-binding).</p>
        <p>(III) The Representing Party will ensure that any employee, agent, advisor, contractor, or other
            representative of the Representing Party also complies with the obligations under this clause.</p>
        <p>(b) For the sake of clarity, "Third Party Discussions" do not include discussions or negotiations in which
            the Representing Party may engage with any Third Party in order to pursue the Business in good faith and in
            the spirit of this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>(22). Force Majeure</strong></p>
        <p>If and to the extent that a Party's performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement, hindered or
            delayed by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil
            disorders, rebellions or revolutions, or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party
            (each, a "Force Majeure Event"), and such non-performance, hindrance or delay could not have been prevented
            by reasonable precautions, then the non-performing, hindered or delayed Party will be excused for such
            non-performance, hindrance or delay, as applicable, of those obligations affected by the Force Majeure Event
            for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues and such Party continues to use its best efforts to
            recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay, including through the use of
            alternate sources, workaround plans or other means. The Party whose performance is prevented, hindered, or
            delayed by a Force Majeure Event will immediately notify the other Parties of the occurrence of the Force
            Majeure Event and describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Force Majeure Event.</p>
        <p>If the Force Majeure Event continues for a continuous period exceeding 30 (thirty) days, the Parties shall
            mutually agree on the future course of action. However, despite all efforts made by the Parties in good
            faith, if the Force Majeure Event continues for a period of 90 (ninety) days, either of the Parties shall
            have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving the other Parties a notice of termination in writing.

            and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
            contained herein. Any invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be replaced with a
            provision that is valid, enforceable, and most nearly gives effect to the original intent of the invalid /

            property rights of any Party in favor of the other, nor shall this Agreement be construed to grant any Party
            any rights in or to the other Party's Confidential Information, except the limited right to use such
            Confidential Information in connection with the Project under this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>(26) Amendments</strong></p>
        <p>Any change, alteration, amendment, or modification to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by

            exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute, differences or claims arising out of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all notices, requests, consents, approvals, agreements,

        <p><strong>(30). Conflicts within agreement</strong></p>
        <p>(a) In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between different parts of this Agreement, the following

        <p><strong>(33). Assignment</strong></p>
        <p>(a) No party may assign, subcontract, or encumber any right or obligation under this Agreement, in whole or
            in part, without the other party's prior written consent; such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
            delayed.</p>
        <p><strong>(34). Set off</strong></p>
        <p>Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, each party shall pay all sums that it owes to the other party
            under this Agreement without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding of any kind, save as may be
            required by law.</p>
        <p><strong>(35) Equitable relief</strong></p>
        <p>Each party recognises that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement may cause the other party
            irreparable harm for which damages may not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, in addition to any other
            remedies and damages available to the other party, each party acknowledges and agrees that the other party
            is entitled to the remedies of specific performance, injunction, and other equitable relief without proof of
            special damages.</p>
        <p><strong>(36). Waiver</strong></p>
        <p>(a) No failure, delay, or omission by either party in exercising any right, power or remedy provided by law
            or under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right, power, or remedy, nor shall it preclude or
            restrict any future exercise of that or any other right, power, or remedy.</p>
        <p>(b) No single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by law or under this Agreement shall
            prevent any future exercise of it or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy.</p>
        <p>(c) A waiver of any term, provision, condition, or breach of this Agreement shall only be effective if given
            in writing and signed by the waiving party, and then only in the instance and for the purpose for which it
            is given.</p>
