            <p class="col-md-4 text-primary">These are short, famous texts in English from classic sources like the Bible or Shakespeare.
                Some texts have
                word definitions and explanations to help you. Some of these texts are written in an old style of
                English.
                Try to understand them, because the English that we speak today is based on what our great, great,
                great,
                great grandparents spoke before! Of course, not all these texts were originally written in English. The
                Bible, for example, is a translation. But they are all well known in English today, and many of them
                express
                beautiful thoughts.</p>

            

            <p class="col-md-4 text-warning">Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
                The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
                The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
                The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.

                The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
                But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
                I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
                And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh.

                Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
                Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
                Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
                And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.</p>

            <p class="col-md-2 text-success">"I'm collecting food for the winter," said the ant, "and I suggest you do the same." And off
                she went,
                helping the other ants to carry food to their store. The grasshopper carried on hopping and singing.
                When
                winter came the ground was covered with snow. The grasshopper had no food and was hungry. So he went to
                the
                ants and asked for food.</p>

            <p class="col-md-2 text-danger">A grasshopper spent the summer hopping about in the sun and singing to his heart's content.
                One day, an ant
                went hurrying by, looking very hot and weary.</p>
