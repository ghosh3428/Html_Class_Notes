        The Kolkata metropolitan area is spread over 1,886.67 km2 (728.45 sq mi)[66]: 7  and comprises 4
        municipal corporations (including Kolkata Municipal Corporation), 37 local municipalities and 24
        panchayat samitis, as of 2011.[66]: 7  The urban agglomeration encompassed 72 cities and 527 towns and
        villages, as of 2006.[67] Suburban areas in the Kolkata metropolitan area incorporate parts of the
        following districts: North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Nadia.[68]: 15  Kolkata,
        which is under the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), has an area of 206.08 km2
        (80 sq mi).[67] The east–west dimension of the city is comparatively narrow, stretching from the Hooghly
        River in the west to roughly the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in the east—a span of 9–10 km (5.6–6.2
        mi).[69] The north–south distance is greater, and its axis is used to section the city into North,
        Central, South and East Kolkata. North Kolkata is the oldest part of the city. Characterised by
        19th-century architecture and narrow alleyways, it includes areas such as Jorasanko, Rajabazar,
        Maniktala, Ultadanga, Shyambazar, Shobhabazar, Bagbazar, Cossipore, Sinthee etc. The north suburban
        areas like Dum Dum, Baranagar, Belgharia, Sodepur, Khardaha, New Barrackpore, Madhyamgram, Barrackpore,
        Barasat etc. are also within the city of Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure).[68]: 65–66  Central
        Kolkata hosts the central business district. It contains B. B. D. Bagh, formerly known as Dalhousie
        Square, and the Esplanade on its east; Rajiv Gandhi Sarani is on its west.[70] The West Bengal
        Secretariat, General Post Office, Reserve Bank of India, Calcutta High Court, Lalbazar Police
        Headquarters and several other government and private offices are located there. Another business hub is
        the area south of Park Street, which comprises thoroughfares such as Jawahar Lal Nehru Road, Abanindra
        Nath Tagore Sarani, Dr. Martin Luther King Sarani, Dr. Upendra Nath Brahmachari Sarani, Shakespeare
        Sarani and Acharay Jagadish Chandra Basu Road.[71] South Kolkata developed after India gained
        independence in 1947; it includes upscale neighbourhoods such as Bhawanipore, Alipore, Ballygunge,
        Kasba, Dhakuria, Santoshpur, Garia, Golf Green, Tollygunge, New Alipore, Behala, Barisha etc. The south
        suburban areas like Maheshtala, Budge Budge, Rajpur Sonarpur, Baruipur etc. are also within the city of
        Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure).[22] The Maidan is a large open field in the heart of the city
        that has been called the "lungs of Kolkata"[72] and accommodates sporting events and public
        meetings.[73] The Victoria Memorial and Kolkata Race Course are located at the southern end of the
        Maidan. Among the other parks are Central Park in Bidhannagar and Millennium Park on Rajiv Gandhi
        Sarani, along the Hooghly River.

        Two planned townships in the greater Kolkata region are Bidhannagar, also known as Salt Lake City and
        located north-east of the city; and Rajarhat, also called New Town and located east of
        Bidhannagar.[22][74] In the 2000s, Sector 5 in Bidhannagar developed into a business hub for information
        technology and telecommunication companies.[75][76] Both Bidhannagar and New Town are situated outside
        the Kolkata Municipal Corporation limits, in their own municipalities.[74]
